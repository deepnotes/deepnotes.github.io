this is an example using math equation in line \(loss_(i,j)=loss_(i,j)^xywh+loss_(i,j)^p+loss_(i,j)^c\) and new line:

\[loss_(i,j)=loss_(i,j)^xywh+loss_(i,j)^p+loss_(i,j)^c\]

\begin{document}



\[
loss\_(i,j)=loss\_(i,j)\textasciicircum{}xywh+loss\_(i,j)\textasciicircum{}p+loss\_(i,j)\textasciicircum{}c
\]






\end{document}
